              <li>4 tablespoons Marsala wine</li>
            
              <li>28 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            
              <li>Â½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            
              <li>3 sprigs fresh basil, leaves stripped from stems</li>
            
              <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            
              <li>1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            
              <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves, or to taste</li>
          </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol> 
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            
            <li>Place each squash half cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to a colander and place over a bowl to drain.</li>

            <li>While squash is baking, heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sausage, breaking it up with a sturdy spoon to remove clumps. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Stir Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and 1 teaspoon salt into the sausage mixture. Add crushed tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add wine and cook for another 30 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil leaves, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
            
            <li>Layer 1/2 of the shredded spaghetti squash, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/2 of the meat mixture in a 4-quart glass baking dish. Repeat layers once more, and top with mozzarella cheese slices.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until cheese is golden, about 1 hour.</li>
            
            <li>Remove from the oven and immediately top with thin basil slices. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving</li>
          </ol>
