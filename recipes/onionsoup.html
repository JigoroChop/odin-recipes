        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>3 onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
                <li>2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>6 ⅓ cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>⅓ cup white wine</li>
                <li>⅓ cup white wine</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>6 (1/2 inch) slices French baguette</li>
                <li>½ cup shredded Gruyère cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add onions; cook, stirring constantly, until golden, 15 to 30 minutes. Add water; cover and cook until onions are very tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle flour into the saucepan; cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken stock and 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon white wine; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer gently until flavors combine, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
                <li>Toast baguette slices until very crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Divide slices among 6 oven-safe soup bowls. Ladle soup on top. Sprinkle Gruyère cheese over each bowl.</li>
                <li>Transfer bowls to the preheated oven; broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
